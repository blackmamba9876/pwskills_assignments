    "\n",
    "Buffering in file handling refers to the practice of temporarily storing data in a buffer (a small, fast memory location) before reading from or writing to a file. This process helps improve the efficiency of file operations by reducing the number of direct I/O operations with the disk, which are relatively slow. When reading, data is read from the disk in large chunks into the buffer, from which smaller, more frequent reads can be quickly served. When writing, data is accumulated in the buffer and written to the disk in larger chunks, reducing the frequency of slow write operations. This mechanism minimizes the overhead and enhances overall performance. In Python, buffering is controlled by the buffering parameter in the open() function."

    "Reading/Writing Data: Perform read or write operations. Data is temporarily stored in the buffer before being written to or read from the disk.\n",
    "Automatic Buffering: By default, Python applies buffering based on the file mode (text or binary). Text mode uses line buffering, and binary mode uses a default buffer size.\n",
    "Flushing the Buffer: Use file.flush() to manually flush the buffer, ensuring all buffered data is written to the disk.\n",
    "Closing the File: Use file.close() or a with statement to close the file, which also flushes and releases the buffer.\n",
